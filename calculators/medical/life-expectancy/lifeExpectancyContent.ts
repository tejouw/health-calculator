      'Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time an individual is expected to live, based on factors such as birth year, current age, demographic characteristics, and health behaviors. While no calculator can predict an individual\'s exact lifespan, life expectancy estimates provide valuable insights into how lifestyle choices, medical conditions, and environmental factors influence longevity. Modern life expectancy calculations incorporate data from large-scale epidemiological studies, actuarial tables, and clinical research spanning millions of individuals across decades. These calculations go beyond simple averages to account for the compounding effects of multiple health behaviors, the reversibility of certain risk factors (like smoking cessation), and the protective benefits of positive lifestyle choices. Understanding your estimated life expectancy serves not as a definitive prediction, but as a powerful motivational tool to make informed health decisions and prioritize the factors that matter most for healthy aging.',

    howToCalculate:
      'Life expectancy calculation begins with baseline demographic data from actuarial life tables published by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Social Security Administration. These tables provide average remaining years of life for individuals of a given age and gender in specific populations. For example, a 40-year-old woman in the United States has a baseline life expectancy of approximately 83 years. This baseline is then adjusted based on individual health and lifestyle factors. The calculation methodology involves assigning "impact values" (measured in years added or subtracted) to various factors based on peer-reviewed research. For instance, current smoking of a pack per day reduces life expectancy by approximately 10-12 years, while regular vigorous exercise can add 3-7 years. The calculation accounts for both direct physiological effects (smoking damages cardiovascular and respiratory systems) and indirect effects (social isolation increases stress hormones and inflammation). Advanced calculators also consider interactions between factors—obesity combined with diabetes has a greater-than-additive negative effect, while exercise plus healthy diet produces synergistic benefits. The final estimate represents the statistical median outcome for someone with your specific combination of characteristics, not a guaranteed lifespan.',

    formulaDetails:
      'The life expectancy formula combines baseline demographic life expectancy with weighted adjustments for modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The general formula structure is: Estimated Life Expectancy = Baseline Life Expectancy (from actuarial tables for your age/gender) + Σ(Impact of each health factor). Each impact factor is calculated based on hazard ratios from large cohort studies. For smoking, the calculation considers pack-years (packs per day × years smoked) with impacts ranging from -5 years for light smoking to -14 years for heavy lifetime smoking. For physical activity, impact is calculated based on metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, with sedentary lifestyle (-4 years), moderate activity (+3 years), and vigorous regular exercise (+7 years). Body Mass Index (BMI) follows a U-shaped mortality curve where both underweight (BMI <18.5, -5 years) and obesity (BMI >35, -8 to -12 years) reduce longevity, while normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) serves as the reference point. Chronic disease impacts are derived from condition-specific mortality studies: type 2 diabetes (-6 years), cardiovascular disease (-9 years), cancer (-7 years, though this varies greatly by type and stage). Social factors have surprisingly large impacts: strong social connections add +5 years while chronic loneliness subtracts -7 years, comparable to smoking. Sleep follows a J-curve where both insufficient sleep (<6 hours, -4 years) and excessive sleep (>10 hours, -3 years) show increased mortality. Diet quality is assessed on scales like the Mediterranean Diet Score or Healthy Eating Index, with excellent diet quality (lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, olive oil) adding +6 years compared to poor Western diet patterns. The formula includes interaction terms—for example, exercise partially mitigates obesity\'s negative impact. Family history provides genetic baseline adjustment: if both parents lived past 90, add +4 years; if both died before 70, subtract -3 years. The final calculation caps minimum remaining life at current age + 5 years (you will not die imminently) and maximum at current age + 50 years (avoiding unrealistic projections for young individuals). Confidence intervals are wide (typically ±10 years) because individual variation is substantial—the healthiest person with "poor" factors might outlive the least healthy person with "good" factors.',

    interpretation:
      'Life expectancy results should be understood as statistical probabilities, not deterministic predictions. The number represents the age to which someone with your exact profile would be expected to live based on population-level data from millions of individuals. Key points for interpretation: (1) Individual variation is enormous—two people with identical calculated life expectancy may differ by 20+ years in actual lifespan due to genetics, luck, and unmeasured factors. (2) Life expectancy is dynamic and changes based on behavior changes. Quitting smoking at age 50 can add 6+ years; developing diabetes at 55 may subtract 6 years. Recalculating annually or after major lifestyle changes provides updated estimates. (3) Confidence intervals are wide. A calculated life expectancy of 85 typically has a 95% confidence interval of approximately 75-95 years. (4) The value lies not in the specific number but in understanding which factors most impact your longevity and are modifiable. If smoking is reducing your life expectancy by 10 years, that is immediately actionable information. (5) Comparison to demographic averages provides context—being 5 years above average is meaningful, but everyone should strive to maximize their potential regardless of relative position. (6) Life expectancy captures quantity but not quality of life. Living to 90 with severe disability from 70 onward differs greatly from healthy years to 85 followed by brief decline. Health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) attempts to capture this but requires different inputs. (7) Results change with age. As you age and avoid mortality hazards, your remaining life expectancy may actually increase slightly each year you survive. A healthy 80-year-old may have higher remaining life expectancy than predicted at age 60. Use your life expectancy estimate as motivation for positive change and framework for prioritizing health interventions, not as a fixed destiny.',

    limitations:
      'Life expectancy calculators have important limitations that users must understand. First and foremost, they provide population-level statistical estimates, not individual predictions. Even the most sophisticated calculators explain only about 30-40% of variance in actual lifespan—the majority is determined by unmeasured factors including detailed genetics, environmental exposures, accidents, luck, and medical care quality. Second, calculators rely on historical cohort data but future medical advances may change outcomes. Someone calculated to live to 80 today may benefit from breakthrough treatments developed in the next 20 years that extend life beyond historical norms. Third, calculators cannot account for unknown risk factors. You may have undiagnosed conditions (early cancer, genetic predisposition) or protective factors (exceptional cardiovascular genetics) not captured in standard inputs. Fourth, impact factors are based on average effects in populations but vary by individual. Some smokers live to 100; some non-smokers die of lung cancer at 60. Your personal response to risk factors depends on genetics and other unmeasured variables. Fifth, lifestyle factors are typically assessed at a single point in time, but real life involves changes. Will you maintain your current exercise routine for 30 years? Will you develop new health conditions? These trajectories cannot be predicted. Sixth, social and psychological factors (resilience, purpose, optimism, trauma history) significantly affect longevity but are difficult to quantify and rarely included in calculators. Seventh, calculators use broad categories (light/moderate/heavy exercise) but precise dose-response relationships matter. Someone doing 145 minutes per week of exercise gets categorized the same as someone doing 200 minutes despite different benefits. Eighth, calculators cannot account for interaction effects between all factors. The combination of poor sleep, high stress, and social isolation may be worse than the sum of individual effects. Ninth, most calculators are based on data from developed Western countries and may not accurately reflect longevity patterns in other populations or ethnic groups with different genetic backgrounds and environmental exposures. Tenth, rare genetic conditions (both positive like exceptional longevity genes and negative like familial hypercholesterolemia) have large impacts but cannot be detected without genetic testing. Finally, life expectancy estimates become increasingly uncertain for extremes—very young or very old ages, very high or very low risk profiles. Despite these limitations, life expectancy calculators provide valuable insights when used appropriately: as general guides for understanding health impacts, motivation for behavior change, and tools for prioritizing interventions, not as precise prophecies.',

    healthRisks:
      'The relationship between modifiable risk factors and life expectancy is supported by decades of epidemiological research. Smoking remains the single largest modifiable risk factor, with current smokers losing 10-14 years of life expectancy on average compared to never-smokers. The impact varies by intensity (pack-years) and duration, but even light smoking (1-5 cigarettes daily) reduces life expectancy by approximately 5 years. The good news is that smoking cessation has immediate and long-term benefits—within 1 year, heart disease risk drops by 50%; after 10-15 years, life expectancy nearly matches never-smokers. Physical inactivity is the second-largest modifiable risk factor. Sedentary individuals (no regular exercise) lose 3-4 years compared to those meeting minimum guidelines (150 minutes moderate or 75 minutes vigorous weekly exercise). High-level exercisers (300+ minutes moderate or 150+ vigorous weekly) gain 5-7 years compared to sedentary peers. Exercise benefits are dose-dependent but show diminishing returns beyond moderate-high levels. Obesity (BMI ≥30) reduces life expectancy by 3-10 years depending on severity, with Class III obesity (BMI ≥40) showing 10-14 year reductions. However, the relationship between weight and mortality is complex—being slightly overweight (BMI 25-29.9) may have minimal impact or even slight protective effect, especially at older ages. Body composition matters more than weight alone: high muscle mass with normal body fat is healthier than normal BMI with high body fat percentage (sarcopenic obesity). Chronic diseases have major impacts: type 2 diabetes reduces life expectancy by 6-8 years if diagnosed at age 50, with earlier onset having greater impact. Cardiovascular disease (heart attack, heart failure) reduces life expectancy by 8-12 years depending on severity and management. Cancer impact varies enormously by type, stage, and treatment response—from minimal impact for highly curable cancers caught early to 10+ years for aggressive late-stage cancers. Hypertension (high blood pressure) that is uncontrolled reduces life expectancy by 5-7 years, but well-controlled hypertension with medication has minimal impact. Social factors have surprisingly large effects: chronic loneliness or social isolation reduces life expectancy by 6-7 years, equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes daily. Strong social connections (close friendships, active social life, community involvement) add 5-6 years compared to isolation. Marriage generally adds 2-3 years for men, less for women. Sleep quality and duration matter: chronic insufficient sleep (<6 hours nightly) reduces life expectancy by 4-5 years, likely through effects on obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immune function. Excessive sleep (>10 hours regularly) also correlates with reduced longevity but may be a marker of underlying disease rather than causal. Chronic high stress, especially from uncontrollable sources (financial strain, caregiver burden, discrimination), reduces life expectancy by 3-5 years through effects on cardiovascular disease, immune function, and health behaviors. Diet quality has major impact: Mediterranean-style diet (high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, olive oil, moderate wine) adds 5-6 years compared to typical Western diet high in processed foods, red meat, and sugar. Excessive alcohol consumption (>2 drinks daily for men, >1 for women) reduces life expectancy by 6-7 years, primarily through liver disease, cancer, and accidents. Light drinking (1 drink daily) may have neutral or slightly protective effect, though this is controversial. Combinations of risk factors amplify risks: obesity + diabetes + sedentary lifestyle has greater-than-additive effect. Conversely, healthy behaviors cluster—people who eat well also tend to exercise, not smoke, and maintain social connections, creating synergistic benefits. The most powerful finding from longevity research is that it is never too late to benefit from lifestyle changes. Even starting exercise at age 70 adds years; quitting smoking at 60 recovers most of the lost longevity. The human body has remarkable capacity for recovery when risk factors are removed and health behaviors adopted.',

    alternativeMeasures:
      'While overall life expectancy provides a useful summary measure, several alternative metrics offer complementary insights into longevity and healthy aging. Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) or Healthy Life Expectancy adjusts total lifespan for years lived with disability or disease. A person might live to 85 but spend the last 15 years with severe limitations (HALE = 70), while another lives to 82 but remains healthy until 80 (HALE = 80). HALE better captures quality of life and is often more important than raw longevity—living well matters more than living long. Disability-Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) similarly measures years without significant functional limitations. Biological age or epigenetic age uses biomarkers (epigenetic clocks like Horvath or Hannum clocks) to measure cellular aging rather than chronological age. Someone who is 60 years old chronologically might have a biological age of 55 (aging slowly) or 67 (aging rapidly) based on DNA methylation patterns. These biological age measurements correlate with health outcomes and mortality risk better than chronological age alone. Frailty indices combine multiple deficit domains (strength, mobility, cognition, nutrition, chronic conditions) to assess vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty predicts mortality, hospitalization, and loss of independence better than any single measure. Functional capacity measures like grip strength, walking speed, and ability to rise from a chair without arms predict longevity remarkably well—decline in these simple physical tests forecasts mortality years in advance. Cardiovascular fitness (VO2 max) is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, with each 1-MET increase in cardiorespiratory fitness associated with 10-25% reduction in mortality risk. VO2 max can be estimated from exercise testing or calculated from vigorous activity capacity. Biomarkers of aging include telomere length (shorter telomeres predict aging, but testing is not standardized), inflammatory markers (chronic elevation of C-reactive protein, IL-6 predicts age-related diseases), metabolic markers (fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel), and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs accumulating in tissues). Composite biological aging scores combine multiple biomarkers to create aging indices. Cognitive reserve and brain health metrics predict both cognitive longevity (avoiding dementia) and overall mortality. Social network analysis maps both quantitative aspects (number of connections) and qualitative aspects (strength of bonds, perceived support) which strongly predict health outcomes. Purpose in life, assessed through validated questionnaires, predicts longevity independent of other factors—people with strong sense of purpose live 2-3 years longer on average. Genetic risk scores based on polygenic analysis of longevity-associated gene variants can now predict exceptional longevity potential, though environment and behavior still dominate outcomes. Activity tracking through wearables provides objective data on daily steps (7,000-10,000 steps associated with optimal longevity), heart rate variability (HRV, a marker of autonomic nervous system health), and sleep quality. Combining multiple measures provides fuller picture than life expectancy alone: someone might have average calculated life expectancy but excellent biological age and functional capacity, suggesting they will live those years in good health. Conversely, someone with above-average life expectancy but high frailty may face many years of disability. The ideal approach assesses both quantity (life expectancy) and quality (health-adjusted measures, functional capacity, biological age) to guide interventions that maximize both lifespan and healthspan.',

    demographicDifferences:
      'Life expectancy varies substantially across demographic groups, requiring adjustment of general estimates for specific populations. Gender is the largest demographic factor: women outlive men by an average of 5-6 years in most developed countries. This advantage is biological (protective effects of estrogen, two X chromosomes providing redundancy for X-linked genetic defects) and behavioral (men engage in riskier behaviors, are less likely to seek medical care, and have higher rates of smoking and alcohol abuse). However, the gender gap has been narrowing as women have increased smoking rates and men have improved health behaviors. Race and ethnicity show large disparities in the United States: Asian Americans have the highest life expectancy (87 years for women, 82 for men), followed by Hispanic/Latino (84/79), White non-Hispanic (81/76), and Black non-Hispanic (78/72). These gaps reflect complex interactions of genetics, socioeconomic factors, healthcare access, discrimination stress, environmental exposures, and health behaviors. Within ethnic groups, variation is enormous—recent Asian immigrants have different profiles than multi-generational Asian Americans. Geographic location matters significantly: life expectancy varies by more than 20 years between U.S. counties, from 67 years in some impoverished rural areas to 89 years in wealthy urban/suburban enclaves. International differences are even larger: life expectancy ranges from below 55 years in some sub-Saharan African countries to over 85 years in Japan, Switzerland, and Singapore. These differences reflect healthcare system quality, socioeconomic development, diet patterns, infectious disease burden, and cultural factors. Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the strongest predictors of longevity: in the U.S., the wealthiest 1% live 10-15 years longer than the poorest 1%, with gradients across the entire income spectrum. SES affects life expectancy through multiple pathways: access to quality healthcare, ability to afford healthy foods, safe neighborhoods for exercise, lower stress, better education about health, and occupational exposures. Education level independently predicts longevity: college graduates live 8-10 years longer than those without high school diplomas, even controlling for income. Education provides health literacy, better jobs, expanded social networks, and cognitive reserve. Marital status affects longevity differently by gender: married men live 7-10 years longer than never-married men, while married women live 2-3 years longer than never-married women. Marriage provides social support, economic benefits, and health behavior reinforcement, but effects depend on marriage quality—bad marriages may reduce longevity. Sexual orientation and gender identity show complex patterns: sexual minority populations face additional stressors (discrimination, violence, family rejection) that can reduce life expectancy, though accepting environments and strong community connections can be protective. Occupation matters: professionals and managers outlive manual laborers by 5-7 years, reflecting both socioeconomic factors and occupational hazards. Military veterans, especially those with combat exposure or service-connected disabilities, show reduced life expectancy compared to civilians. Immigration status creates interesting patterns: recent immigrants often have better health and longevity than expected based on SES (the "healthy immigrant effect"), possibly due to selection factors, strong social networks, and healthier traditional diets. However, this advantage often erodes across generations as immigrants adopt less healthy Western lifestyle patterns. Rural versus urban residence shows mixed patterns: while urban areas generally have better healthcare access, some rural areas (particularly in "Blue Zones" like Sardinia or Okinawa) show exceptional longevity due to tight-knit communities, active lifestyles, and traditional diets. Conversely, rural areas with poverty, limited healthcare access, and high rates of smoking and obesity show reduced life expectancy. Religious involvement and spirituality generally associate with 2-3 years greater longevity, likely through social support, health behaviors (many religions discourage smoking/drinking), stress reduction, and sense of purpose. Birth cohort effects mean younger generations may have different longevity trajectories than current older adults—millennials show some concerning health trends (rising obesity, mental health issues) that may reduce their life expectancy relative to Baby Boomers, while benefiting from medical advances. Climate and environmental factors affect longevity: extreme heat and cold, air pollution, water quality, and environmental toxins all impact life expectancy. These demographic differences underscore that life expectancy calculators using single population-level data may not accurately estimate longevity for individuals from specific demographic subgroups. The most accurate estimates would incorporate detailed demographic data, though this information is often unavailable or simplified in practical calculators.',

Twin studies show that identical twins have more similar lifespans than fraternal twins, but the difference is moderate, not dominant. Exceptionally long-lived individuals (centenarians) have higher genetic contribution (perhaps 30-40%), but for most people, lifestyle choices are more important than genetic inheritance. Even people with "good longevity genes" can substantially reduce their lifespan through poor health behaviors, and people with genetic disadvantages can compensate significantly through excellent lifestyle choices.

          'No single factor dominates, but if forced to choose, not smoking is the most impactful single decision for most people. Current smoking reduces life expectancy by 10-14 years on average—more than any other modifiable factor. For non-smokers, regular physical activity is likely the single most powerful intervention, adding 5-7 years and preventing numerous age-related diseases. However, the most important insight is that longevity results from combinations of factors. Someone who never smokes, exercises regularly, eats well, maintains healthy weight, manages stress, sleeps well, and has strong social connections can add 15-20+ years compared to someone with all the opposite characteristics. Synergistic effects mean the whole is greater than the sum of parts.',

        question: 'Do people who live to 100 have special genes?',
        answer:
          'Centenarians (people living to 100+) do have genetic advantages, but it is more complex than single "longevity genes." Studies of centenarians find they have combinations of genetic variants that protect against age-related diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, diabetes) and may slow cellular aging. However, most centenarians also share lifestyle commonalities: lifelong non-smoking, regular physical activity, healthy weight, strong social connections, purpose in life, and stress resilience. The "Blue Zones" (regions with exceptional longevity like Okinawa, Sardinia, Ikaria) demonstrate that environment and lifestyle can create population-level exceptional longevity even without unique genetics. Most people have genetic potential to live into their late 80s or 90s if they optimize lifestyle factors—exceptional longevity beyond 100 requires both good genetics and excellent behaviors.',

      {
        question: 'How does my life expectancy change as I get older?',
        answer:
          'Life expectancy is dynamic and generally increases slightly as you age and survive mortality hazards. For example, a healthy 60-year-old might be calculated to live to age 82 (22 more years). If they remain healthy and reach 70, their life expectancy might now be 85 (15 more years), not 82. This happens because by surviving to 70, they have demonstrated they did not succumb to various causes of death that kill some people in their 60s. Each year you survive healthy, you prove you are in the healthier subset of your age cohort. However, developing major health conditions (heart attack, cancer, diabetes) can suddenly reduce life expectancy. Recalculating periodically, especially after major health changes or lifestyle modifications, provides updated estimates that reflect your current status.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Should I make financial or legal decisions based on my calculated life expectancy?',
        answer:
          'No. Life expectancy calculators are educational tools, not precise enough for financial planning, estate planning, retirement decisions, or legal matters. The uncertainty is too large—your actual lifespan could easily be 10-20 years different from the estimate. For financial and legal planning, work with qualified professionals (financial advisors, estate attorneys, actuaries) who can incorporate appropriate ranges and plan for various scenarios. Retirement planning, for instance, should assume you might live to 95 or 100 to avoid outliving your resources, even if your calculated life expectancy is 85. Similarly, estate planning should not assume specific timelines. Use life expectancy estimates for health motivation and prioritization, but engage appropriate professionals for consequential financial and legal decisions.',

    whatIs:
      'Yaşam beklentisi, doğum yılı, mevcut yaş, demografik özellikler ve sağlık davranışları gibi faktörlere dayanarak bir bireyin ortalama olarak yaşaması beklenen sürenin istatistiksel bir ölçüsüdür. Hiçbir hesaplayıcı bir bireyin tam yaşam süresini tahmin edemese de, yaşam beklentisi tahminleri yaşam tarzı seçimlerinin, tıbbi durumların ve çevresel faktörlerin ömür üzerindeki etkisi hakkında değerli bilgiler sağlar. Modern yaşam beklentisi hesaplamaları, on yıllar boyunca milyonlarca bireyi kapsayan büyük ölçekli epidemiyolojik çalışmalardan, aktüeryal tablolardan ve klinik araştırmalardan elde edilen verileri içerir. Bu hesaplamalar, basit ortalamaların ötesine geçerek birden fazla sağlık davranışının birleşik etkilerini, belirli risk faktörlerinin geri dönüşümlülüğünü (sigara bırakma gibi) ve olumlu yaşam tarzı seçimlerinin koruyucu faydalarını hesaba katar. Tahmini yaşam beklentinizi anlamak, kesin bir tahmin olarak değil, bilinçli sağlık kararları almak ve sağlıklı yaşlanma için en önemli faktörlere öncelik vermek için güçlü bir motivasyon aracı olarak hizmet eder.',

    howToCalculate:
      'Yaşam beklentisi hesaplaması, Dünya Sağlık Örgütü (WHO), Hastalık Kontrol ve Önleme Merkezleri (CDC) ve Sosyal Güvenlik İdaresi gibi kuruluşlar tarafından yayınlanan aktüeryal yaşam tablolarından temel demografik verilerle başlar. Bu tablolar, belirli popülasyonlarda belirli bir yaş ve cinsiyetteki bireyler için ortalama kalan yaşam yıllarını sağlar. Örneğin, Amerika Birleşik Devletleri\'nde 40 yaşındaki bir kadının temel yaşam beklentisi yaklaşık 83 yıldır. Bu temel değer daha sonra bireysel sağlık ve yaşam tarzı faktörlerine göre ayarlanır. Hesaplama metodolojisi, hakemli araştırmalara dayanan çeşitli faktörlere "etki değerleri" (eklenen veya çıkarılan yıllar cinsinden ölçülür) atamayı içerir. Örneğin, günde bir paket sigara içmek yaşam beklentisini yaklaşık 10-12 yıl azaltırken, düzenli şiddetli egzersiz 3-7 yıl ekleyebilir. Hesaplama hem doğrudan fizyolojik etkileri (sigara kardiyovasküler ve solunum sistemlerine zarar verir) hem de dolaylı etkileri (sosyal izolasyon stres hormonlarını ve iltihabı artırır) hesaba katar. Gelişmiş hesaplayıcılar ayrıca faktörler arasındaki etkileşimleri de dikkate alır—obezite ile diyabetin birleşimi toplamsal etkiden daha büyük olumsuz etkiye sahipken, egzersiz artı sağlıklı diyet sinerjik faydalar üretir. Nihai tahmin, özel özellik kombinasyonunuza sahip biri için istatistiksel medyan sonucu temsil eder, garantili bir yaşam süresi değil.',

    formulaDetails:
      'Yaşam beklentisi formülü, temel demografik yaşam beklentisini değiştirilebilir ve değiştirilemez risk faktörleri için ağırlıklı ayarlamalarla birleştirir. Genel formül yapısı şudur: Tahmini Yaşam Beklentisi = Temel Yaşam Beklentisi (yaş/cinsiyet için aktüeryal tablolardan) + Σ(her sağlık faktörünün etkisi). Her etki faktörü, büyük kohort çalışmalarından elde edilen tehlike oranlarına göre hesaplanır. Sigara için, hesaplama paket-yılları (günlük paket sayısı × sigara içilen yıllar) dikkate alır ve hafif sigara içimi için -5 yıldan ömür boyu yoğun sigara içimi için -14 yıla kadar etkilere sahiptir. Fiziksel aktivite için etki, haftalık metabolik eşdeğer (MET) dakikalarına göre hesaplanır: hareketsiz yaşam tarzı (-4 yıl), orta düzey aktivite (+3 yıl) ve şiddetli düzenli egzersiz (+7 yıl). Vücut Kitle İndeksi (VKİ) U-şeklinde mortalite eğrisi izler; hem düşük kiloluluk (VKİ <18.5, -5 yıl) hem de obezite (VKİ >35, -8 ila -12 yıl) ömrü azaltırken, normal kilo (VKİ 18.5-24.9) referans noktası olarak hizmet eder. Kronik hastalık etkileri, duruma özel mortalite çalışmalarından türetilir: tip 2 diyabet (-6 yıl), kardiyovasküler hastalık (-9 yıl), kanser (-7 yıl, ancak bu tür ve evreye göre büyük ölçüde değişir). Sosyal faktörler şaşırtıcı derecede büyük etkilere sahiptir: güçlü sosyal bağlantılar +5 yıl eklerken kronik yalnızlık -7 yıl çıkarır, sigara içmeye eşdeğerdir. Uyku, hem yetersiz uykunun (<6 saat, -4 yıl) hem de aşırı uykunun (>10 saat, -3 yıl) artan mortalite gösterdiği J-eğrisi izler. Diyet kalitesi, Akdeniz Diyeti Skoru veya Sağlıklı Beslenme İndeksi gibi ölçeklerde değerlendirilir; mükemmel diyet kalitesi (bol sebze, meyve, tam tahıllar, balık, zeytinyağı) kötü Batı diyeti kalıplarına kıyasla +6 yıl ekler.',

Sayı, milyonlarca bireyden elde edilen popülasyon düzeyindeki verilere dayanarak tam profilinize sahip birinin yaşaması beklenen yaşı temsil eder. Yorumlama için önemli noktalar: (1) Bireysel varyasyon çok büyüktür—aynı hesaplanmış yaşam beklentisine sahip iki kişi, genetik, şans ve ölçülmemiş faktörler nedeniyle gerçek yaşam süresinde 20+ yıl farklılık gösterebilir.

    limitations:
      'Yaşam beklentisi hesaplayıcılarının kullanıcıların anlaması gereken önemli sınırlamaları vardır. Her şeyden önce, bireysel tahminler değil popülasyon düzeyinde istatistiksel tahminler sağlarlar. En sofistike hesaplayıcılar bile gerçek yaşam süresindeki varyansın sadece yaklaşık %30-40\'ını açıklar—çoğunluk detaylı genetik, ölçülmemiş sağlık durumları, çevresel maruziyetler, kazalar, şans ve tıbbi bakım kalitesi dahil olmak üzere ölçülemeyen faktörler tarafından belirlenir. İkincisi, hesaplayıcılar tarihi kohort verilerine dayanır ancak gelecekteki tıbbi gelişmeler sonuçları değiştirebilir. Bugün 80 yaşına kadar yaşaması hesaplanan biri, önümüzdeki 20 yılda geliştirilen çığır açan tedavilerden yararlanarak tarihi normalin ötesinde yaşam süresini uzatabilir.',

    healthRisks:
      'Değiştirilebilir risk faktörleri ile yaşam beklentisi arasındaki ilişki, on yıllarca süren epidemiyolojik araştırma tarafından desteklenmektedir. Sigara içimi, en büyük değiştirilebilir risk faktörü olmaya devam etmektedir; mevcut sigara içenler, hiç sigara içmeyenlere kıyasla ortalama 10-14 yıl yaşam beklentisi kaybederler. Etki, yoğunluğa (paket-yılları) ve süreye göre değişir, ancak hafif sigara içimi bile (günlük 1-5 sigara) yaşam beklentisini yaklaşık 5 yıl azaltır. İyi haber, sigarayı bırakmanın ani ve uzun vadeli faydaları olmasıdır—1 yıl içinde kalp hastalığı riski %50 düşer; 10-15 yıl sonra yaşam beklentisi neredeyse hiç sigara içmeyenlerle eşleşir. Fiziksel hareketsizlik, ikinci en büyük değiştirilebilir risk faktörüdür. Hareketsiz bireyler (düzenli egzersiz yok) minimum yönergeleri karşılayanlara kıyasla (haftada 150 dakika orta veya 75 dakika şiddetli egzersiz) 3-4 yıl kaybederler.',

    alternativeMeasures:
      'Genel yaşam beklentisi yararlı bir özet ölçü sağlarken, birkaç alternatif metrik ömür ve sağlıklı yaşlanma hakkında tamamlayıcı bilgiler sunar. Sağlık-Ayarlı Yaşam Beklentisi (HALE) veya Sağlıklı Yaşam Beklentisi, toplam yaşam süresini engellilik veya hastalık ile geçen yıllar için ayarlar. Bir kişi 85 yaşına kadar yaşayabilir ancak son 15 yılını ciddi kısıtlamalarla geçirebilir (HALE = 70), başka biri 82 yaşına kadar yaşayabilir ancak 80\'e kadar sağlıklı kalır (HALE = 80). HALE, yaşam kalitesini daha iyi yakalar ve genellikle ham ömürden daha önemlidir—iyi yaşamak uzun yaşamaktan daha önemlidir.',

    demographicDifferences:
      'Yaşam beklentisi, demografik gruplar arasında önemli ölçüde değişir ve belirli popülasyonlar için genel tahminlerin ayarlanmasını gerektirir. Cinsiyet en büyük demografik faktördür: kadınlar çoğu gelişmiş ülkede erkeklerden ortalama 5-6 yıl daha uzun yaşarlar. Bu avantaj hem biyolojiktir (östrojenin koruyucu etkileri, X ile bağlantılı genetik kusurlar için yedeklilik sağlayan iki X kromozomu) hem de davranışsaldır (erkekler daha riskli davranışlarda bulunur, tıbbi bakım alma olasılıkları daha düşüktür ve daha yüksek sigara içme ve alkol kullanımı oranlarına sahiptirler). Bununla birlikte, kadınlar sigara içme oranlarını artırdıkça ve erkekler sağlık davranışlarını iyileştirdikçe cinsiyet farkı daralmaktadır.',
